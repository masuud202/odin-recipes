        *HTML
            #HREF Links
            #Images
            #Paragraphs
            #Bold and Italics
            #Subpages
        *Command Prompt

POST-PROJECT REFLECTION:

    *Becoming more familiar with html syntax(img,href, etc)
    *Becoming more fimiliar with git commands, especially commits and push
    *Extremely comfortable with manuevering through commandprompt.
